## Hello world
I'm Alex, h e l l o. See that purple glory? The unpacked monitors? The mic stand, the RedBull (not glorifying this awful habit), the water (to feel less bad about the RedBull), and the headphones?

This is my workspace. Like many in this WFH world, I've emerged from bed to gently place my caboose in a chair and interact with the world almost exclusively through screens. Early on in 2020 I took FCC's frontend certs and fell in love with coding - the endless learning, possibilities, and problem solving of it all. I used to practice math on Khan Academy in the off hours, but coding quickly filled that position - it was what I did to blow off steam at day's end. 

The more time I spent in front of screens - the more I wanted to **build** bits of the internet, the more I wanted to play an active role in developing it.

And again, like many of us, life threw me a load of curveballs 2020 - 2021 forcing me to take a long hiatus (you can see it on my GitHub activity). In 2022 I decided to come back full-on with this schedule:

8am - 4pm: freelancing as a paid social media marketer; optimizing ads across various social platforms, working with cool people at a cool agency, loving the opportunity, but knowing I want to code for a living

4pm - 630pm: exercising, skating, dreading the potential of nuclear war, dining, trying to be more helpful, consuming coffee, wishing I knew more, hoping coffee helps me focus, having a lot of ~thoughts~, etc...

*takes a deep breath* 

...and from 630pm to 1030pm (sometimes later): trying my darndest to self-teach programming with lots of help from friends and the internet (so much help, thank you all).

I got a lot of support and encouragement from a friend of mine who made this leap years ago and hasn't looked back since. I was hesitant and felt like I had too much ground to make up, but still loved sitting down and automating work tasks. Then it happened...

On Valentine's Day, a massive Douglass Fir up in Mt. Tamalpais shed a tree-sized limb that nearly crushed me to death. The sound was so loud I immediately jolted awake to find the branch just a few feet from where my head was. Oddly enough, this near-death experience reset my perspective and reminded me that there's no sense in waiting for the "perfect" time and that progress was to be made.

I decided to take a chance - to leave my full-time role and pursue a career as a dev as aggressively as possible with this renewed appreciation for the possible brevity of life. YOLO, right? (sorry)

My last day is 3.14.22 (pi day, woo!). From then on (through the 100 days), I'm comitted to coding and applying to jobs full-time with the 'reach' goal of getting hired by the end of the challenge. With tempered expecations, I'm excited to connect with and support challengers, join a community, get/give mentorship, and - if I learn enough to be valuable to someone's business - attain the holy grail: a career doing what keeps me up to the wee hours staring at more screens!

Not sure if anyone will ever lay eyes on this, but if it helps you, catches your attention, inspires you, makes you cringe, or anything in between - reach out to me and tell me about it.
