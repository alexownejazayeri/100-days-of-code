# Applying For Jr. Dev Gigs

## Overview
I'm going to try to compile a list of notes from different resources here and actually put them to use until I land my first dev job.

## Process

### DonTheDev

- Marketplaces
  - LinkedIn
    - But apply on the company site, not through LinkedIn

  - angelist.com
    - smaller companies
    - align your values with theirs

  - Self Study
    - This is my path; going to take rejection until someone hires me!
    - If can't do this by the end of #100DaysOfCode then reassess
- Getting first job
  - Don't play the numbers games
    - don't just apply online
    - be creative and think outside the box
    - get someone in the company to champion or fight for you
    - tap your network (bootcamps, college friends, dev friends, etc.)
    - get a person to vouch for you -- get recognized and stand out!
  - If network dry
    - get on LinkedIn
    - get on Twitter
    - stalk people at the companies you're applying for!
  - Build a personal brand
    - create blog posts, videos, open source projects
    - try to get conference talks
    - make yourself visible with content!
  - focus on the technical stuff
    - algorithms projects
    - technical screens
    - hands-on projects
    - code reviews
    - soft skills questions
    - practice, practice, practice!
    - focus on what type of value a company wants from you!
- Spend 2-3 weeks on 3-4 companies (vs. bulk apply)
  - pick companies you'd actually want to work at
    - make sure they have an open position that you're close to qualified for
    - apply the steps above
    - continue for improvement
    - be systematic!

    - They're looking for candidates as much as candidates are looking for jobs
