## Day 0: 01 March 22

### Daily Log

- Worked on the React [tic-tac-toe](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html) tutorial to review and take note of best practices. 
  - Key concepts: React components (subclasses, functions), managing state (passing, lifting), dynamically rendering components with functional methods like map.
- Customized #100DaysOfCode resources e.g.(hello world story, tightened up readme, resources, and log).

Next steps:
- Spruce up GitHub README.md
- Finalize best practices doc
- Review [MDN's JS refresher](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/A_re-introduction_to_JavaScript) and wrestle with examples in node to firm up fundamentals

### Journal

Seung was right, the React docs are great. Excited to dive into the TypeScript docs at his recommendation too. Generally, feeling good and looking forward to putting more hours into this challenge. It feels a bit slow to start since I'm parsing through the intro stuff, but that's par for the course - gotta start somewhere!

## Day 1: 02 March 22

### Daily Log

- Rejigged 100-days-of-code repo for cleanliness; added subdirectories to organize daily logs and project work
- Spruced up my Github README.md; inspired by [Thai Braga](https://github.com/Thaiane/Thaiane).
- Solved problems on Edabit
  - Reviewed: Builtin Date object, modular arithmetic, truthiness with '!!'

Next steps:
- Refactor old FreeCodeCamp React projects
- Review the intro tutorial and parse for best practices - make a markdown doc with my own examples to firm up knowledge



### Journal

I felt pretty good today, but realized I spent almost all my time "sprucing" and not as much time writing JS & React as intended. If I'm being honest, was torn between whether or not I was bikeshedding or getting valuable experience with markdown. 

Spent most of my time revising the README.md and hello-world.md the last couple days. Even more honesty: I think I'm spending too much time trying to stand out with personality (the marketer in me) to make up for not having enough "good" code and projects.

That said, I feel good about the new repo organization with subdirectories for daily log and projects. Got a bit of JavaScript in on Edabit before wrapping up -- excited to dig into the meaty goals tomorrow now that all the "personality" is in place. The value in doing all this was to take ownership of my story and -- in full open source spirit -- live through this experience as transparently as possible for others who want to learn.

That's enough feelings for now I guess. Tomorrow's a new day!

## Day 2: 03 March 22

### Daily Log

- Spent time reviewing JS basics i.e.(var, let, const -- scoping, redeclaration, and reassignment)
- Added React intro tutorial and work in progress notes to repo

Next steps
- Refactor old FreeCodeCamp React projects
- Complete, review, and revise React 'best practices' log
- Review MDN's JS refresher and play with example in node to review

### Journal

Today wasn't as productive as I wanted it to be. Worked an 8-hour shift and had friends visiting from out of town, so minimal time between work and commuting to Oakland to get any coding done. My girlfriend is leaving for a month, so tonight was a short 20-minute sprint to play with var, let, and const via node in my terminal.

Feeling confident about the differences in scope, declaration, and assignment. Going to make up for lost time tonight tomorrow by doubling my time and then it's time to hold steady to the challenge! I really want to grow as quickly as possible to nail down a gig and do what I love for a living. This dream gets more motivating with each day in the challenge -- been having a blast, but maybe that's because I haven't dived in and really struggled with a challenging problem yet.

Note for future days.

### Journal

I stayed up really late working on this to make up for lost time. The dust is starting to shake off and I'm feeling the same sense of curiosity and wonder that hooked me on programming in the first place. Feeling good about scope, blocks, pre- and post-ES6 variable declaration and stuff, and hungry for more.

Taking a bit to ramp up, but I'm generally excited and looking forward to more of this challenge. It's still early days as I review the fundamentals, but it almost feels like now that I'm coming back from a bit of a hiatus, that I can go a level deeper than when I began to understand a bit more of what's happening under the hood of JavaScript when you're declaring variables, writing functions, thinking of scope, and so on.

Started to feel a lot better about scope, global variables and objects, and the 'this' keyword. I want to dive into the DOM and better understand how JavaScript works cross-platform (from browser to server-side js). Feels good to have a growing curiosity again!

Up next:
- Review the "under the hood" stuff e.g.(call stack, heap, execution context, javascript engine, Google V8)

### Journal

As I make through JavaScript fundamentals and brush up on the basics, I'm getting more curious about the underlying "under-the-hood" behaviors of the browser. I'm also interested in NetWorkding and reading more resources on how to write clean, readable JavaScript.

I'm happy to be spending time re-learning and firming up my JS skills, but it's definitely taken a bit to get over the hump of feeling "behind". Very cool how quickly things come back though. That's part of the beauty of programming I guess: it's logical. Sometimes things seem to behave in weird ways, but it's nice that things are sort of meant to be understood and standardized (thanks ECMA & Brandon Eich!).

Going to keep working tonight!

### Journal

Today, I was reacquainted with the beauty of JavaScript (ooh, ahh). To get a better sense of what was happening with hoisting, JS behavior around the equality of objects, and mutability of variables declared with let and const.

There's a lot to learn about what's happening under the hood, but at this early stage I think I've learned enough for a bit. I feel curious about what's happening here, but also that I'm not coding at an advanced enough level to need to know about how data is handled by JavaScript engines like Google V8, since I'm not writing super complicated projects.

Upward and onward, I'm going to continue working through the fundamentals and keep these things in mind, but not spend too much more time on them. Need to strike up a balance between theoretical and practical knowledge, but I'm sure that never goes away -- still excited and getting more energized by the day!

I can feel all the JS knowledge from before my hiatus coming back, which has actually served as a nice springboard into aiming for a deeper understanding of JS this go around.

Today I was less focused because I slept poorly last night. Feeling good, but also like I'll never be prepared enough and that's just a feeling that's going to stick around. Hope to keep working and keep a cool head through this. Can be real hard when you just want that job so bad, but best to let that passion shine through in preparation and projects. Gotta prioritize sleep and make sure not to burn out before starting.

### Journal

Today I worked on the 'Time Travel' section of React's tic-tac-toe tutorial. Felt a bit lost on this one at times, but I think it's because I'm rushing, which is problematic. That said, I'm glad that this one left exercises to the reader (see: 'MERNG' above). Felt really good to get my feet wet thinking about how to work with data between components like this. Going to take that momentum and apply it to upcoming portfolio projects!

The interview went well yesterday and today I worked loads on trying to wrap my head around GraphQL. I think I may be burning the candle at both ends this week and am going to direct all my focus into building this interview project. I feel good, but also like I'll never "know enough" in the sense that there's simply so much to be across and so much depth to this industry that I can spend and entire lifetime and still only scratch the surface. The reason software is exciting is the same reason it can be overwhelming: the learning and ideas are virtually limitless.

Fighting the overwhelm and taking things one GraphQL resolver at a time!

## Intermission

...it's 03/21 (it's technically d20 wow) and while I haven't been updating this, I've been coding non-stop.

Here's a quick update:

-  Friday March 11, I got an first-round interview with an events company. 
-  Out of sheer excitement to ace my first take-home and work with their (very cool) team, I started working tirelessly to learn GraphQL (2 #100DaysOfCode goals in 1 project, woot!)
-  Due to this bout of rapid learning, I stopped posting about my progress, but seeing as I'll continue this even after getting hired (if) - have to keep the habit up through interviews and all!

TL;DR - got busy with interviews, kept coding, didn't document and interact with the community as much.

Continuing that today and picking up on day 20 (0-indexed ofc).

### Journal

Today was my final interview for a company I'm excited about. As always, trying to temper expectations. I feel a bit off - wasn't able to sleep at all last night from interview jitters I s'pose. Anyway, the first time can always be nerve wracking but I'm glad to have gotten the experience either way.

Up next, I seriously need to fix my sleep hygiene and built a more structured routine lol. For now, I've been bingeing loads of docs and info to give the interviews at this company my all; however, it's not sustainable. I need to sprinkle in more small projects and little wins.

Knowledge is compounding and sleep dedicates knowledge to memory. It's tough right now with so much changing, but surely a routine will help give a sense of order.

### Journal

Today was my final interview for a company I'm excited about. As always, trying to temper expectations. I feel a bit off - wasn't able to sleep at all last night from interview jitters I s'pose. Anyway, the first time can always be nerve wracking but I'm glad to have gotten the experience either way.

Up next, I seriously need to fix my sleep hygiene and built a more structured routine lol. For now, I've been bingeing loads of docs and info to give the interviews at this company my all; however, it's not sustainable. I need to sprinkle in more small projects and little wins.

Knowledge is compounding and sleep dedicates knowledge to memory. It's tough right now with so much changing, but surely a routine will help give a sense of order.

Spent the better part of the day digging into fuzzy string search and the underpinnings of Levenshtein Distance. Attempted an implementation of this algorithm in js and realized I still have a long ways to go. Tried to set up the matrix for the problem and ran into a bug where I built a matrix of matrices based on a variable pointing to a reference to the same array -- when tried to edit a row individually, all rows would change since they pointed to the same 'row' or array object. Going to work on debugging that tomorrow.

I feel ecxited and nervous about whether or not this company will take me. Given that it's my first interview, I know the odds and that it's likely I'll have to keep hustling through interviews until someone takes a chance on me. Anyway, I'm stoked to hear back and learn from it all anyway.

### Journal

Still recovering from bad sleep the last couple (maybe few) weeks. It's clearly affecting my ability to focus and retain information, so hoping tonight's not another late one. As if I had a choice, I've just been laying there and staring at the back of my eyelids.

Anyway, now that I scratched fuzzy search itch, it's time to dig into projects again! I've let these languish a bit, but learning this algorithm was well worth it.

### Journal

Finishing up the tic-tac-toe tutorial was a good way to gain an appreciation for a) how much work game development is b) the non-trivial work it take to make trivial things happen on a computer screen.

Slept a bit better last night and feel like I'm getting a little caught up after several hellish weeks of all-nighters, deadlines, and high-stakes interviewing. Now it's up to me to keep on growing my skills and interviewing while I wait to hear back from this events company that shall remain nameless for now. There are other companies I'd like to work with/for of course, but I really like this team and tech stack, so hoping they decide to go with me.

Either way, I'm trying to keep busy in the meantime and not build my expectations too high. Feel like part of that battle is adopting a stoic disregard for the outcomes and keep moving. Will see where that stoicism takes me and look forward to continued learning. Until tomorrow...

Today was good! Felt nice to spend so much time working in the project. I felt a bit slow to pick it back up again, but it's amazing how quickly it comes back when things are modular and you can focus on one bit over another. I'm really starting to see how much time can get burnt just trying to wrap your head around what some code is doing.

Got the core functionality of C0dle done tonight. Excited to share it around even though worlde has almost definitely died. Cheers to doing it anyway...still waiting to hear back about that job, but things take time and I must press on.

Gonna keep writing portfolio projects and things.

### Journal

Was a bit tired and groggy today. My heart wasn't totally in this session, but I guess that can happen from time to time. Can feel that I need to get better at committing to rapidly failing and attempting new solutions to things instead of thinking the first "big idea" is going to address the problem at hand instantly.

Feels good though, feels like there's a ton of growth ahead. Excited to look back on today's problems and think they're small in comparison.

Decided to take today a bit slower and catch up on sleep / recalibrate. Went for a hike out in Santa Cruz with a friend and going to bed early. Felt a bit slow working on C0dle today, but I'm honestly fine with it. Have been burning the candle at both ends and it's clear that the clarity that comes with good rest and a routine outshine caffeine-fueled nights of hacking at stuff until it just works.

## 2nd Intermission

...it's 04/12 (day 42 -- can't believe that) and I took another break to focus on interviews and projects.

Here's another update:

-  Poured all of my energy into interviews with two companies. Company A is in the events space and Company B is in LIDAR and self-driving tech.
-  Here's a quick summary
   -  Company A
      -  Behavioral Interview - went well, got loads of positive feedback, liked their team and culture.
      -  Take-home project - built a GraphQL API and deployed through AWS and Serverless for extra credit.
      -  Technical Interview - render components in React using the API I built and build a search bar
      -  Final Call - I guess I made it up to the COO's desk and they pivoted at final step, but was a good learning experience either way.
   -  Company B
      -  Behavioral Interview - went well, recruiter was professional and asked good questions
      -  Project Demo - positive feedback from interviewer, pushed me through to the next step
      -  Autogenerated rejection email with no response as to what the disconnect was; oops.
- With these interviews under my belt I feel less anxious about this goal and less like I have to pull away from everything else to make these work.
- Attempting balance in all things moving forward prioritizing little, consistent touches and bits of effort vs. trying to make a herculean life shift in a matter of weeks
- Built a mostly-baked beta version of a Wordle clone called Code-le that I'm excited to share on Twitter today to get some early thoughts
- Fun projects and experience lay ahead, I feel more relaxed about the process now knowing that I've made it to the final steps with at least one company -- just need to scale up now!

Picking it back up today with an hour of code on CODE-LE and some planning to get more potential jobs into the pipeline.

### Journal

Been feeling a bit up and down. Today I fellt a simultaneous sense of overwhelm and excitement since Code-le is now live (and buggy). A reminder that everything is a constant work in progress and can always stand to be made faster, more performant, more useable, prettier, more accessible, more easily maintained, easier to deploy, more relevant, and so on.

Learning to relish in having something somewhat done and keep pressing on anyway. Things are never "done". They might be "good for now", but not "done" -- and definitely not perfect.

Looking forward to building a bit more structured learning as my self-guided curriculum feels out of balance. Cheers to another day of progress.

That said, I'm really grateful for the communityt that's formed around this #100DaysOfCode. Inspiring to see folks flocking to software from all walks of life and -- equally moving -- folks who've already broken into tech working with us "freshies" to get up to speed an into work.

Hope to be a beacon this way and help others along the way. Think I'm honestly too deep in my own head.

Today I found out I'm Covid positive, so was a bit of a roller coaster but managed to focus up and devote the better part of the evening to learning some intro CI/CD. Felt good about learning this -- was interested to find out Yarn and Jest are also open source Facebook. It's really sort of amazing how much big tech has accomplished in such a short period of time, and they've been so open about sharing those learnings with the community. I used to have a blanket feeling that big tech was brooding and bad for being accelerationist, but my opinions are shifting there.

It's complicated.

Anyway, it's been a bit of a day but we press on and do good things!

Learned a lot about CI/CD and testing today. Realized how big this world is and that there's virtually endless stuff to learn. Learning to cope with the overwhelm of realizing I'll truly never feel like I know enough and that things are constantly changing -- instead of trying to learn it all I'm going to focus on fundamentals and really nailing down the basics.

Glad to have mentors and folks looking out and guiding me through this because otherwise I'd feel very lost. I'm a lucky person for that.

Today was a good day. Learned a lot about CI/CD and Github Actions. Also took the dive into Firebase and I'm realizing I actually enjoy learning about new backend technology.

BaaS is a cool concept and I'm excited to understand more about AWS, CircleCI, testing, Typescript, and good coding patterns. Still feel like I'm only scratching the surface with what I'm actually capable of with JavaScript and want to keep pushing there, but learning the SWDLC is just as important since you're unlikely to jump straight into algorithms and super technical stuff.

Also really grateful to have mentors and a be networking in such a chill space. People have been so willing to help and point me in the right directions, my faith in humanity is restored from the level of mentorship in the dev community alone. I hope to be as cool as the people I'm asking questions from some day. Let's be honest, that's what I'm really doing this for.

Early on, I thought that studying hard and contacting my network for open opportunities would be enough to make the transition speedy, but after looking at the types of folks who're getting hired out there, I can see that there's just...so much work that I have to do.

I'd say I'm inspired to work hard. I'd also say that I'm combatting imposter syndrome today. This stuff is hard and -- all things considered -- the #100DaysOfCode community is getting me through it.

I'm confident things will work out in their own time. For now I'm trying to strike that special balance between rushing and being too lax. I think the best gauge is whether or not I'm able to produce or demonstrate knowledge against certain core ideas in JavaScript, HTML/CSS, React, etc., etc., which is what's causing the most stress right now. I somehow feel like I've been able to get through projects, but the stress of wanting that first position makes it hard for me to commit knowledge to memory.

It's this sort of ironic, backwards psychological effect of feeling like you need the thing to calm down and needing to calm down to learn the thing well enough to get it (and retain it).

For the rest of this #100DaysOfCode, I'm promising to be patient with myself so I can reap the actual rewards of learning -- to get the compound effects of daily consistency vs. rushing through sprints.

I'll be ready when I am, but rushing will leave gaps in the critical foundational ideas I need to succeed and that'll cause problems down the road, so I'm going to assess my skills for gaps and work on strengthening my JavaScript foundations every day. Will still focus on projects, but want to balance better between learning and doing.

Cheers to the 2nd half of this experience. It also goes without saying that I've done much more than I was capable of before starting the process. I think I'm just recognizing halfway through that this is a process -- a long one that people struggle with, go to school to get degrees for, and spend a lifetime building a career around. I really shouldn't think that I'm special enough to inhale everything I need to get a job faster than anyone else doing the challenge.

Best to refocus on:
1. Consistency
2. Helping those around me
3. Practice, practice, practice
4. Apply, apply, apply
5. Firm up basics/fundamentals before advanced topics


Anyway, long entry today. Excited for what tomorrow has in store!

### Journal

Today was rough. I had another call with a recruiter who seemed excited until we got to chatting about my college experience. He said something to the effect of, "I hate to break it to ya, but if you're in competition with someone who has a degree, 9 times out of 10 they'll go with the person with the degree", which wasn't exactly confidence-inspiring.

I wonder if, even though I'm learning all this stuff and putting in the hours that I'll continue to fight an uphill battle. It begs the question: is it worth it to go back to school and just get the technical education? If anything, to avoid the nuisance and frustration of dealing with these types? Or is that giving in?

Trying to prove a point feels like a terrible, practically spiteful reason to get an education -- a way to practically ensure failure.

The alternative is to become an amazing coder without it and prove the point that way. There are loads of people stuck in the belief that you have to have a technical education from a top university to create value as a programmer. While it doesn't come without massive effort and time invested, I don't believe the college degree is necessary.

It does, however, seem to be a barrier for the first job. Just need to keep applying and applying until I can land something I guess.

Going to focus on strengthening my skills and becoming undeniably valuable instead of "going back to school to prove a point", which...ya know...is not smart.

I guess it's getting tough and I'm finding out if this is something I'm really cut out for. Again. I'm grateful for the network around the #100DaysOfCode challenge and hope to keep growing and making connections through this process.

Oof, I've been having a tough time getting motivated because I feel like I'm not retaining things as well. To be honest, I don't think I'm being systematic enough about the time that I'm spending on this each day. I'm also not being intentional about taking time away during the day.

On the one hand, I really love what I'm learning. On the other, I feel like I'm burning out without having started because I'm getting overwhelmed by how much there is to learn.

All that said, this reminds me of when I first started learning how to play instruments. I always wanted to have all these ideas and innate ability...how nice it

Had a relaxing day. I realized, after some advice from a recruiter, that I've been pushing too hard. To be more accurate, It's not that I'm pushing too hard, but that I'm letting myself get overwhelmed and am not being systematic enough in this process.

> "Obstacles are detours in the right direction." - Gabby Bernstein

She sent me that quote too, which I've now written up on my whiteboard.

I think it's a case of not tracking progress in a more quantitative, logical way to gauge whether things are working or not. The same could be said for whether or not I'm retaining information well e.g., if I were tracking progress against a course or had concepts that I was studying against in a structured way.

Think I'm going to use FCC's curriculum and try to do more advanced research on the concepts. Will try to test / demonstrate my knowledge in public too and see what comes of that.

All that said, I only have 24 hours in a day and need to be systematic about building study time, application time, content creation time, and so on into a day without getting overwhelmed or burnt out before even starting.

Felt focused today! I'm still so new, so the code doesn't exactly pour out of my fingertips and sometimes I get stuck on things like config and set-up (see: Jest for React). With each step forward, the various technologies and software practices e.g.(TDD, CI/CD, UX/UI, etc.) seem deeper and more cavernous than before, but I'm realizing that's all the more reason to take the common advice of focusing on projects and learning what's directly applicable vs. trying to read every single word of the docs.

I will say though, that it feels less punishing and more exciting to uncover a new practice, technology, paradigm, etc. with each passing day of the challenge. I've settled into having fun with the challenge of it all because -- while my code will never be "perfect" -- I can get closer to building things that are useful and even approach being professional.

As always, the road is long but I'm less daunted by it. I've picked my adventure and am coming to terms with being new and having a lot to learn.

Now the trick is to stay focused and consistent. Also to get paid for this, coz...you know...gotta make a living.

More tomorrow.

Spending a lot of time studying testing and very curious about whether or not there's a true north for unit vs. integration testing. Seems like the line is very blurry and -- to be honest -- I think I'm spending too much time on it, but now that I've gotten this far, I feel close to having a basic understanding.

After this week, I want to shift focus from the logistics and CI/CD-type tasks back into **interview prep**, **javscript fundamentals**, **project planning**, and **job applications**.

I was feeling nervous about interviewing again and I think that's why I've been bikeshedding so hard with testing. You know you're bikeshedding when you're looking into how to get certified as an ethical hacker just to prove that you know pen testing.

Think the much more valuable skill as an entry-level dev is actually understanding how JavaScript works and maybe having a working understanding of TypeScript fundamentals too.

Probably React hooks and some projects that show you know a bit of Git with testing sprinkled on top to stand out, but not full on QA engineer CI/CD mastery, obviously.

Was talking to a mentor today and had a good reminder that it's a marathon and not a sprint. Anyway, I feel good about how much I've learned and think the next step is to tie up testing in a neat bow by getting some decent test coverage (80% - 100%) on code-le and moving on to a new project.

I don't want to ship bad code and I'm learning a lot of helpful things about what Git/GitHub can do, but don't want to stall out on this project. I'm falling behind on my MERNG goals and am feeling that I'm beyond the mid-way mark on this challenge.

Less than two months to get 3 MERNG projects, a job, 30 web pages, and a working knowledge of TypeScript under my belt...I've got my work cut out for me!

This was a long process and there's still so much configuration to do. I'm learning that testing, while it's worthwhile and rewarding to understand, is taking a lot longer than I had planned. It's a force to be reckoned with, not a thing you pick up in a weekend of hacking.

As far as my ~feels~ I'm doing a lot better than I was last week. I think it finally happened; I feel like a dev. Something about writing code that manages your code so you can code faster makes you confront that you're "in it". And all of this after a few months.

I feel good about progress and better about spending so much time on implementing CI/CD in code-le. Worth it to go beyond a browser-based IDE solving one-off JS problems and digging into how code sorta gets built in a more "real-world" setting. Also seems like you learn once and then manage configs unless there's some big update to how things get done. Anyway, I'm excited to kick off another project, but feel good about spending this time on code-le, because I can start off so much stronger for the next portfolio sprint.
